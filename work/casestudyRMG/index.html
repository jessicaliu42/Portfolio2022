                            <h3>Background</h3>
                            <p><a href="https://www.rmgdogs.org/">Rescue Me Georgia</a> is a non-profit, local animal rescue organization based in Georgia. Their mission is to save the lives of innocent animals through donations and volunteer efforts. RMG operates as a foster-based rescue and collaborates with various rescue groups in Northeast Georgia.</p>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Rescue Me Georgia maintains a website that offers services to adopters and supporters, including donation options, volunteering opportunities, fostering information, and adoption resources. However, some adopters need help navigating the website.
                                </p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <img src="asset/CaseStudyImg/redline.png">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                As I began reviewing and assessing the site from scratch, I observed that some features appeared unnecessary:  
                            </p>
                       
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        The logo needs to be added but visible on their social media profiles.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Donation Button must be more compelling as a “call to action.”                                   
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The calendar function doesn't serve a purpose, and the cart icon in the menu bar is unnecessary on the main page.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        We questioned whether having two lines of options in the navigation bar is essential.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Images are not displaying correctly on the store page.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>Challenge Statement</h3>
                                <p>Our challenge was to enhance people's understanding of RMG services, improve RMG's reputation, extend its positive influence in society, and boost contributions for donations and volunteering through the website.
                                    </p>
                            <h3>The Solution</h3>
                            <p>We addressed these issues by redesigning the Rescue Me Georgia website. Our approach involved providing clear information about animal rescue and offering valuable services related to animal adoption, donations, and volunteering. Creating a professional and trustworthy website aimed to enhance RMG's reputation, increase engagement, and contribute to its growth as a more prominent and impactful organization.

                        <h3>How do we start the UX research? </h3>
                        <p>
                            To initiate our UX research, we conducted a series of activities to gain insights into the issues faced by rescue animal organizations and users and identify problems with the RMG website.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Our research methods included:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>User Interviews: </b>We conducted three user interviews with individuals with experience with animal adoption. The questions focused on their adoption experiences and their feedback regarding the RMG website.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li> Do you own any adopted pets? </li>
                                <li>What would motivate you to donate to an animal rescue?</li>
                                <li> Did you research the organization from which you adopted your pet?</li>
                                    <li>What is your initial impression of the RMG site?</li>
                                        <li>After one minute on the site, what is your second impression?</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p><b>Usability Testing:</b> We performed three usability tests to observe how users interacted with the RMG website.</p>
                        <p><b>Google Surveys:</b> We collected responses from eight people through Google surveys. These surveys also concentrated on adoption experiences and RMG website feedback.</p>    
                        <h3>Research Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>We analyzed the results from our interviews and surveys and organized them into an Affinity Diagram. Surprisingly, we found that many people had experience with pet adoption. These individuals emphasized the importance of an animal rescue organization's reputation, trustworthiness, and commitment to being a no-kill shelter. These factors influenced their decision to donate to or support such organizations.

                               <b>Positive Feedback about RMG's Site:</b> 
                                Users provided positive feedback about RMG's website, highlighting its comprehensive information, professional appearance, and user-friendly adoption process.

                                <b>Areas of Improvement Identified:</b>
                                However, areas were identified for improvement, including concerns about the calendar feature, small font size, a need for more images related to RMG, and issues with loading product pictures in the shop section.
                                </p>

                                    <b>The Proposed Benefits of Updating RMG:</b>
                                    We believe that updating Rescue Me Georgia can enhance user confidence in the organization's commitment to animal welfare. We aim to achieve this by redesigning the navigation header to prioritize essential information and featuring the organization’s success stories.

                        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            To inform our website redesign, we conducted a competitive analysis. We compared RMG to four other non-profit organizations: Atlanta Humane Society, Petfinder.com, Mutt Madness, and FurKids. This analysis will help us understand how RMG can improve and stay competitive within animal rescue organizations.

                            <li><b>Hero Image:</b> The hero image is crucial, especially for first-time users. It is essential to select a pet-related image to convey that it’s an animal rescue organization.
                            </li>

                               <b> Menu Bar:</b> All these websites have a menu bar with fewer than five options, making navigation simple for users. The placement of the donation button is prominently visible.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Logo Placement:</b> The logo is consistently positioned in the top-left corner, providing brand consistency and easy recognition.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Color Scheme:</b> Each organization's website follows a primary color scheme. This observation has informed our decision to select a direct color scheme for our redesign.

                        <p>
                            Conducting card sorting and creating site maps is an excellent approach to redesigning the navigation bar and footer of the website. These methods allow you to organize and structure the menu bar effectively. Additionally, implementing dropdown menus to group similar options together is a practical way to improve user navigation and enhance the overall user experience. This thoughtful approach will likely make it easier for users to find the information they need on the Rescue Me Georgia website.

                        <p>
                            Dividing the navigation bar into five sections—about, adopt, donate, get involved, and stories—sounds well-structured. This categorization clarifies and helps users quickly locate the information they seek. Each section has a distinct purpose, making it intuitive for visitors to navigate the Rescue Me Georgia website and access the relevant content. This organization aligns with the user-friendly principles observed on other successful nonprofit organization websites and should contribute positively to the user experience.

                            Three main tasks users of RMG should be able to complete: <b>Investigate RMG, donate to RMG, and adopt from RMG.</b> All these tasks should lead back to one another so the user can avoid facing a dead end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <b>Investigate RMG:</b>Users interested in learning about RMG should easily find detailed information about the organization, its mission, history, and success stories. Make sure this section has clear pathways to both donation and adoption options.
                        </p>
                       <p>
                            <b>Donate to RMG:</b> Users who want to support RMG financially should be able to do so quickly. Include a prominent "Donate" button and explain how donations will help the animals. Also, include links or pathways to the "Investigate RMG" section for those who want to learn more before donating.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        <b>Adopt from RMG:</b> Users interested in adopting a pet should be able to browse available animals, view adoption procedures, and contact RMG for adoption inquiries. Ensure that from this section, users can also explore the organization's background and consider donating if they wish to support the cause further.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        By interconnecting these tasks and providing clear navigation paths between them, we create a user-centric website that guides visitors through their journey without encountering dead ends, ultimately enhancing their experience on RMG's website.
                       </p>
                        <h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
                        <div class="row">
                            <img src="asset/CaseStudyImg/RMG_logo.jpeg">
                        </div>
                        <p>We discovered that RMG has a logo on their Facebook and Instagram pages, but it's not present on their website.
                            </p>
                            <p>The existing logo featuring peaches, representing the state of Georgia, has a great visual appeal. With this understanding, we have decided to revamp RMG's logo and overall website branding to give it a more professional, enjoyable, and polished appearance.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                            <img src="asset/CaseStudyImg/styleguide_rmg.png">
                                        </div>
                                    <p>
                                        We've chosen to incorporate the peach and green colors from the original logo and intend to infuse these colors and graphical elements into the navigation areas and webpages. Additionally, we've introduced a cat into the logo, symbolizing the diversity of adopted animals in the shelter. This new design approach aims to enhance the visual appeal and convey a sense of warmth and inclusivity for the Rescue Me Georgia website.

                                To ensure we were following the right path during the website design development, we began with low-fidelity designs and conducted usability testing at each stage of the process.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Low-fidelity prototypes</h3>
                        <div class="row">

                        <p>
                            To ensure that the low-fidelity wireframes and navigation system were understandable to users, we conducted three rounds of usability testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Usability Result:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Confusion about the Shop Menu:</b> Users were confused about the “Shop” menu under the "Donation" tab. This suggests that the placement or labeling of this menu might need adjustment to make it more intuitive.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Confusing Donation Naming:</b> There is also confusion related to naming the "Donation" category, possibly in relation to the "Get Involved" section. This indicates a need to clarify these two sections’ distinctions, possibly through revised naming or layout.
Addressing these usability concerns is crucial to ensuring that users can easily understand and navigate the low-fidelity wireframe and, ultimately, the final website. Adjustments based on these test results should enhance the overall user experience.
                            </li>

                                <b>About Section Wireframe Issue:</b> There appears to be a slight wireframe issue in the "About" section. Specific details regarding the issue would be helpful for further refinement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Navigation Back to Home:</b> Users faced challenges when returning to the homepage. Some users mistakenly went to the "Adopt" tab instead. This suggests needing a more prominent "Home" button or tab to improve navigation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Header Size:</b> Feedback indicates that increasing the size of the header would be beneficial, making it more noticeable and intuitive for users.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Add "Rescue Me Georgia" to the Header:</b> Incorporating the organization's name, "Rescue Me Georgia," into the header is valuable for branding and clarity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Positioning and Sizing Adjustments:</b> Some minor adjustments in terms of positioning and sizing are recommended, although specific details would be helpful to address these concerns effectively.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            By implementing these usability recommendations, we can enhance our mid-fidelity prototype’s user experience and clarity, making it more user-friendly and aligned with our design goals.
