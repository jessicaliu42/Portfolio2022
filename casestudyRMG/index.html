                            <p>We redesigned a website from Rescue Me Georgia, a non-profit local animal rescue organization’s website. The Goal of this project is to help adoptees find the information they need as quickly as possible when they land on the site for the first time, and to redesign the logo for Rescue Me Georgia’s site.</p>

                            <h3>Background</h3>
                            <p>Rescue Me Georgia is a non-profit local animal rescue organization from Georgia. Their abilities are to save innocent lives upon donations and volunteering. RMG is a foster based rescue. They collaborated with various rescues in the Northeast of Georgia.</p>
                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Rescue Me Georgia owned a website to provide several services for adopters and supporters. Those services include donation, volunteer, fostering, and adoption. Adopters might enhance  some issues while browning the site.
                                </p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <img src="asset/CaseStudyImg/redline.png">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                As I started to redline and evaluatie the site from the beginning, I noticed that some of the features are not necessary in the site.   
                            </p>
                       
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Logo is missing, but it’s showing on their social media accounts.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Donation Button needs to feel an “call an action”                                        
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The calendar serves no purpose, and cart icon in the menu bar has no purpose in the main page
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Is it necessary to have two lines of options in the navigation bar?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The images are not showing in the store page
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>Challenge Statement</h3>
                                <p>Our challenge was to improve people's understanding of RMG services, help RMG to establish a good reputation, and spread the good influence to society, and increase contributions for donation and volunteering from the site.
                                    </p>
                            <h3>The Solution</h3>
                            <p>We redesign the current Rescue Me Georgia website by providing clear information about animal rescue and useful services about animal adoption, donation, and volunteering. With a professional and trustworthy website, this would help to establish reputations, increase people to get involved, and build into a bigger and stronger organization.

                        <h3>How do we start the UX research? </h3>
                        <p>
                            To help us understand problems between rescue animal organizations and users, and digging more problems about the site, we conducted 3 user interviews with animal adoption experiences, 3 usability testings and 8 people’s Google surveys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The questions would focus on their own adoption experience, and feedback about RMG website.                        </p>
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Do you own any adopted pets?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What would attract you to donating to an animal rescue?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Did you do any research concerning the organization from where your animal was adopted?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What is your first impression of the RMG site?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After 1 minute, what is your second impression?
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Research Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>We organized our interview and survey results into an Affinity Diagram. Surprisingly, we discovered that there is a range of people who have at least one animal adoption experience in the past. They care about the animal rescue organization’s reputation, trustworthy, and no killer shelter. 
                            </p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <img src="asset/CaseStudyImg/emg_ad.png">
                            </div>
                            <p>The positive feedback about RMG’s site has good depth information, professional looking, and the adoption process is easy to understand. </p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the calendar feature is questionable, the font size is too small, more pictures about RMG, and shop’s item pictures are not loaded.
                                </p>
                                <p>We believe that updating Rescue me Georgia will allow our users to feel secure that the organization is caring for their animals. We might be able to help if we redesign the navigation header so that users can find important information first and if we highlight the success stories of the organization.
                                    </p>
                        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                        <p>To give us a better idea for our website redesign, we conducted a competitor analysis. We compared to four other non-profit organizations including Atlanta Humane Society, Petfinder.com, Mutt Madness, and FurKids.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <img src="asset/CaseStudyImg/CA_RMG.jpg">
                        </div>
                        <p>There’s some common features in those organizations‘ websites, such as the placement of features. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The hero image plays a big role when a user comes to the site for the first time. This is important to choose a pet related image as a hero image, because it tells this is an animal rescue organization. 
                                </p>
                                <p>All of the menu bar’s options are not over five options, and easy to understand to the user. 
                                        The placement of the donation button is visible. The Logo is always on the left-top. 
                                        We can tell there’s a main color scheme for each organization’s website, and that leads us to pick a main color scheme for our redesign.
                                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To redesign the navigation bar’s options and footer, I conducted card sorting and site maps which helped me sort the options for the menu bar. Dropdown menu feature regrouped similar options together.

                        <p>
                                I divided the navigation bar into five sections: about, adopt, donate, get involved, and stores. 
                        </p>

                                Three main tasks users of RMG should be able to complete: Investigate RMG, donate to RMG, and adopt from RMG. All these tasks should lead back to one another so that the user does not meet a dead end.

                        <p>We found out RMG has a logo from RMG’s facebook and IG, but we couldn’t find the logo on the website.

                            <p>It’s really nice looking and we understand that peaches represent the state of Georgia.
                                    We decided to redesign the RMG logo and website branding to give it a more professional, fun, and clean look.

                                    <p>
                                            We selected the peach and greens from the original logo and planned to add color and graphic elements to the navigation areas and page to create. Added the cat in the logo means various of adopte animals in the shelter.

                                We definitely will reach out to the organization we can. I will keep working on this project in the future, and make it look more solid.

                                <p>Collaboration is very important. I had a good time working with two awesome teammates. I learned a lot of ideas and concepts about rescue animal organization during this project. The process from UX research to UI Design came out smoothly. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>User Testing gives us a solid foundation in the designing process. We had a lot of testing to make sure we were on the right track.
